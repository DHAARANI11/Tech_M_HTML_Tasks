                <li>½ teaspoon garam masala  or pav bhaji masala or any other masala powder </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon kasuri methi (or 2 tbsps coriander leaves) </li>
                <li>2 tablespoon cream as needed (optional) </li>
                <li>1 large onion chopped finely </li>
                <li>¾ to 1 cup tomatoes chopped mashed or pureed (do not use very sour tomatoes)</li>
                <li>2 carrots chopped or as needed </li>
                <li>¼ to ½ cup green peas </li>
                <li>¼ cup capsicum (bell pepper) – chopped </li>
             </ul>
             <h4>Steps to make Pasta</h4>
             <ol>
                <li>Fine chop 1 medium onion (½ cup), 2 medium tomatoes (1¼ cup deseeded & chopped or 1 cup pureed). I use 1 cup pureed tomatoes. Grate or mince 2 to 3 garlic cloves & ½ inch ginger to make 1½ to 2 teaspoons ginger garlic.</li>
                <li>Peel & chop 1 medium carrot (½ cup) & ¼ cup bell peppers. I also use ¼ cup green peas & 2 tablespoons tender/young sweet corn. If you don’t prefer veggies in your masala pasta you may simply skip all of these.</li>
                <li>You will also need
                    <ul>
                        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste)</li>
                        <li>¾ to 1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon Kashmiri Red chilli powder (for a spicy version use up to 1¼ tsp)</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon turmeric (optional)</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large pot. When the water begins to boil, add 1 teaspoon salt, 1½ cups pasta & 1 tsp oil (optional).</li>
                <li>Cook the pasta al dente on a medium flame. Pasta should be soft yet cooked but not chewy. Refer the package for exact cook time as each brand has a different cook time. Roughly you will boil for 8 to 9 mins.</li>
                <li>Once done drain the pasta to a colander. Save/ reserve ¾ cup pasta cooked water before draining. You can use this towards the end to bring the pasta to consistency.</li>
                <li>Heat 1½ tablespoons oil & 1½ tablespoon butter (optional) in a pan. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds. When the seeds begin to sizzle, add garlic & ginger. Fry for a minute.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onions and fry until they turn golden.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped vegetable and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the salt & spices – red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, turmeric (optional). If you want you can also add cumin and fennel powder.</li>
                <li>Add tomatoes & tomato ketchup or passata or tomato paste.</li>
                <li>Mix and cook on a medium to medium-high heat until the masala begins to smell good or release oil. Make sure the smell of uncooked tomatoes is gone & your veggies are cooked through. If not, reduce the heat and cook on a low heat until the veggies are tender.</li>
                <li>Pour ¼ to ½ cup water or pasta cooked water or stock. I used ½ cup. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Cook until the masala becomes slightly thick, aromatic and saucy. Do not dry out the masala completely at this stage. Add the kasuri methi.</li>
                <li>Add cooked pasta & mix well. If the masala is dry, splash more water. Taste test and add more salt if needed. Cover and cook on a low to medium heat until the pasta becomes hot, for about 2 mins.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Coriander leaves and serve masala pasta hot. If you want you may add 2 to 3 tablespoon heavy cream or ¼ cup grated cheese on the hot pasta.</li>

                <h3>Chicken soup</h3>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>It’s hard to take a parade around Soup Town without a quick jaunt through everyone’s favorite smoky, scoopy, top-able chicken tortilla soup.
   
                   Thin, but not too brothy. Just enough to stand up to deep, cozy spoonfuls and piles on piles on piles of toppings but not feel like a chili or stew. Tender chicken shreds, buttery pinto beans, all the veg flavor but no big chunks, just the right amount of heat throughout…
                   
                   Ugh, is there a park bench somewhere? We might be here a while.
                   
                   It’s hard to pinpoint exactly the origin of tortilla soup, but it is generally attributed to Central Mexico and especially popular in Mexico City, where it was possibly born in the nearby state of Tlaxcala (which in Nahuatl means “land of the corn” or “place where tortillas abound”). In this great guest post by Lorena Masso over on the ful-filled blog, she talks a lot about how this soup in particular represents the blending of Indigenous and Spanish cultures in much of Mexican cuisine. For example, she says Spaniards are generally thought to have introduced the concept of soup while corn is, of course, an important and vital ingredient in native culture.
                   
                   Lorena also talks about how tortilla soup can be found all over Mexico and the toppings and ingredients can definitely vary from state to state. But no matter where you find it, you can always count on a rich chicken broth, roasted tomatoes, and chilis.
                   
                   It is a pretty ubiquitous soup here in the U.S. as well, and it seems everyone has a recipe/style they love most. This is ours, with some shifts in ingredients and method based on preferred texture and taste. And oof, do we love it.</p>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                   <li>Aromatic veggies</li>
                   <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
                   <li>Chicken thighs</li>
                   <li>Beans</li>
                   <li>Veggie broth</li>
                   <li>Toppings</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps to make chicken soup</h4>
                <ol>
                   <li>We preferred a buzz through the food processor, but you could certainly do a rough chop if that’s more your soup texture. Sauté until soft and fragrant.</li>
                   <li>Simmer. Add your crushed tomatoes, broth, and chicken thighs and let them simmer for a bit.</li>
                   <li>Shred & stir. Once cooked, pull the chicken out to shred and then add back in along with the beans and any extra broth you might want.</li>
                   <li>Go time, party time. Get topping, friends.</li>
